<h1>THE MUSIC</h1>
<p><b>
Twenty One Pilots use a variety of instruments including piano, synthesizer, drums, vocals, and the ukulele. <br>
The band has revealed on the website reddit that they do not have guitar featured on any of their music <br>
due to the fact that neither Joseph nor Dun can play. The songs are often poetry based, and Joseph has stated that <br>
if the poetry is too long he will start rapping to fit them in.<br>

<br>The band span many genres and are generally difficult to assign. However, they have referred to themselves as <br>
schizophrenic pop, an unofficial subgenre of pop.<br>

<br>All members of the band, past and present, identify as Christian, and many of the songs contain allusions to <br>
and messages about Christian theology and God. However, the band is not itself considered a Christian band<br>
and enjoys mainstream exposure.<br></b></p>
